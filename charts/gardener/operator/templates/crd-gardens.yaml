                              WatchCacheSizes contains configuration of the API server's watch cache sizes.
                              Configuring these flags might be useful for large-scale Garden clusters with a lot of parallel update requests
                              and a lot of watching controllers (e.g. large ManagedSeed clusters). When the API server's watch cache's
                              capacity is too small to cope with the amount of update requests and watchers for a particular resource, it
                              might happen that controller watches are permanently stopped with `too old resource version` errors.
                              Starting from kubernetes v1.19, the API server's watch cache size is adapted dynamically and setting the watch
                              cache size flags will have no effect, except when setting it to 0 (which disables the watch cache).

                                          If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                                          should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                          For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                          "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                          the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                          index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                          referencing a part of an object.

                              WatchCacheSizes contains configuration of the API server's watch cache sizes.
                              Configuring these flags might be useful for large-scale Shoot clusters with a lot of parallel update requests
                              and a lot of watching controllers (e.g. large ManagedSeed clusters). When the API server's watch cache's
                              capacity is too small to cope with the amount of update requests and watchers for a particular resource, it
                              might happen that controller watches are permanently stopped with `too old resource version` errors.
                              Starting from kubernetes v1.19, the API server's watch cache size is adapted dynamically and setting the watch
                              cache size flags will have no effect, except when setting it to 0 (which disables the watch cache).
