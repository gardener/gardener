                              Configuring these flags might be useful for large-scale Garden clusters with a lot of parallel update requests
                              and a lot of watching controllers (e.g. large ManagedSeed clusters). When the API server's watch cache's
                              capacity is too small to cope with the amount of update requests and watchers for a particular resource, it
                              might happen that controller watches are permanently stopped with `too old resource version` errors.
                              Starting from kubernetes v1.19, the API server's watch cache size is adapted dynamically and setting the watch
                              cache size flags will have no effect, except when setting it to 0 (which disables the watch cache).

                              WatchCacheSizes contains configuration of the API server's watch cache sizes.
                              Configuring these flags might be useful for large-scale Shoot clusters with a lot of parallel update requests
                              and a lot of watching controllers (e.g. large ManagedSeed clusters). When the API server's watch cache's
                              capacity is too small to cope with the amount of update requests and watchers for a particular resource, it
                              might happen that controller watches are permanently stopped with `too old resource version` errors.
                              Starting from kubernetes v1.19, the API server's watch cache size is adapted dynamically and setting the watch
                              cache size flags will have no effect, except when setting it to 0 (which disables the watch cache).
