    description: 'Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the previously
      defined environment variables in the container and any service environment variables.
      If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be
      unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the
      $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
      Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
      exists or not. Defaults to "".'
