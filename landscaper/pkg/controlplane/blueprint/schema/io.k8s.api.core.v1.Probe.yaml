description: Probe describes a health check to be performed against a container to
  determine whether it is alive or ready to receive traffic.
properties:
  exec:
    $ref: blueprint://schema/io.k8s.api.core.v1.ExecAction.yaml
    description: One and only one of the following should be specified. Exec specifies
      the action to take.
  failureThreshold:
    description: Minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed
      after having succeeded. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  httpGet:
    $ref: blueprint://schema/io.k8s.api.core.v1.HTTPGetAction.yaml
    description: HTTPGet specifies the http request to perform.
  initialDelaySeconds:
    description: 'Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness
      probes are initiated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes'
    format: int32
    type: integer
  periodSeconds:
    description: How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10 seconds.
      Minimum value is 1.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  successThreshold:
    description: Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful
      after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness and startup. Minimum
      value is 1.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  tcpSocket:
    $ref: blueprint://schema/io.k8s.api.core.v1.TCPSocketAction.yaml
    description: TCPSocket specifies an action involving a TCP port. TCP hooks not
      yet supported
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds:
    description: Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully
      upon probe failure. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes
      running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes
      are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected
      cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds
      will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod
      spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately
      via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and
      requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is
      1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.
    format: int64
    type: integer
  timeoutSeconds:
    description: 'Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1
      second. Minimum value is 1. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes'
