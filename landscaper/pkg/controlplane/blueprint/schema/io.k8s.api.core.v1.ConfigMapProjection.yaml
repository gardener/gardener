  Adapts a ConfigMap into a projected volume.

  The contents of the target ConfigMap's Data field will be presented in a projected volume as files using the keys in the Data field as the file names, unless the items element is populated with specific mappings of keys to paths. Note that this is identical to a configmap volume source without the default mode.
properties:
  items:
    description: If unspecified, each key-value pair in the Data field of the referenced
      ConfigMap will be projected into the volume as a file whose name is the key
      and content is the value. If specified, the listed keys will be projected into
      the specified paths, and unlisted keys will not be present. If a key is specified
      which is not present in the ConfigMap, the volume setup will error unless it
      is marked optional. Paths must be relative and may not contain the '..' path
      or start with '..'.
