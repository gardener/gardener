  omitManagedFields:
    description: OmitManagedFields indicates whether to omit the managed fields of
      the request and response bodies from being written to the API audit log. This

      otherwise the managed fields will be included in the API audit log. Note that
      this can also be specified per rule in which case the value specified in a rule
      will override the global default.

      The default audit level is None, but can be overridden by a catch-all rule at
      the end of the list. PolicyRules are strictly ordered.
