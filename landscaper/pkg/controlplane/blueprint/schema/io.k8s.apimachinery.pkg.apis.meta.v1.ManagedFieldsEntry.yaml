description: ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version
  of the resource that the fieldset applies to.
properties:
  apiVersion:
    description: APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set
      applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion
      field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot
      be automatically converted.
    type: string
  fieldsType:
    description: 'FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format
      and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"'
    type: string
  fieldsV1:
    $ref: blueprint://schema/io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.FieldsV1.yaml
    description: FieldsV1 holds the first JSON version format as described in the
      "FieldsV1" type.
  manager:
    description: Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
    type: string
  operation:
    description: Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry
      being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
    type: string
  subresource:
    description: Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object,
      or empty string if the object was updated through the main resource. The value
      of this field is used to distinguish between managers, even if they share the
      same name. For example, a status update will be distinct from a regular update
      using the same manager name. Note that the APIVersion field is not related to
      the Subresource field and it always corresponds to the version of the main resource.
    type: string
  time:
    $ref: blueprint://schema/io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.Time.yaml
    description: Time is timestamp of when these fields were set. It should always
      be empty if Operation is 'Apply'
type: object
