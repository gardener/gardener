Secret volumes support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.","type":"object","properties":{"defaultMode":{"description":"Optional: mode bits used to set permissions on created files by default. Must be an octal value between 0000 and 0777 or a decimal value between 0 and 511. YAML accepts both octal and decimal values, JSON requires decimal values for mode bits. Defaults to 0644.
