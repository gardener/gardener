# Changing the API

This document describes the steps that need to be performed when changing the API.
It provides guidance for API changes to both (Gardener system in general or component configurations).

Generally, as Gardener is a Kubernetes-native extension, it follows the same API conventions and guidelines like Kubernetes itself. The Kubernetes
[API Conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md) as well as [Changing the API](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md) topics already provide a good overview and general explanation of the basic concepts behind it.
We are following the same approaches.

## Gardener API

The Gardener API is defined in the `pkg/apis/{core,extensions,settings}` directories and is the main point of interaction with the system.
It must be ensured that the API is always backwards-compatible.

### Changing the API

**Checklist** when changing the API:

1. Modify the field(s) in the respective Golang files of all external versions and the internal version.
    1. Make sure new fields are being added as "optional" fields, i.e., they are of pointer types, they have the `// +optional` comment, and they have the `omitempty` JSON tag.
    1. Make sure that the existing field numbers in the protobuf tags are not changed.
    1. Do not copy protobuf tags from other fields but create them with `make generate WHAT="protobuf"`.
2. If necessary, implement/adapt the conversion logic defined in the versioned APIs (e.g., `pkg/apis/core/v1beta1/conversions*.go`).
3. If necessary, implement/adapt defaulting logic defined in the versioned APIs (e.g., `pkg/apis/core/v1beta1/defaults*.go`).
4. Run the code generation: `make generate`
5. If necessary, implement/adapt validation logic defined in the internal API (e.g., `pkg/apis/core/validation/validation*.go`).
6. If necessary, adapt the exemplary YAML manifests of the Gardener resources defined in `example/*.yaml`.
7. In most cases, it makes sense to add/adapt the documentation for administrators/operators and/or end-users in the `docs` folder to provide information on purpose and usage of the added/changed fields.
8. When opening the pull request, always add a release note so that end-users are becoming aware of the changes.

### Removing a Field

If fields shall be removed permanently from the API, then a proper deprecation period must be adhered to so that end-users have enough time to adapt their clients.

Once the deprecation period is over, the field should be dropped from the API in a two-step process, i.e., in two release cycles. In the first step, all the usages in the code base should be dropped. In the second step, the field should be dropped from API. We need to follow this two-step process cause there can be the case where `gardener-apiserver` is upgraded to a new version in which the field has been removed but other controllers are still on the old version of Gardener. This can lead to `nil` pointer exceptions or other unexpected behaviour.

The steps for removing a field from the code base is:
1. The field in the external version(s) has to be commented out with appropriate doc string that the protobuf number of the corresponding field is reserved. Example:

   ```diff
   -	SeedTemplate *gardencorev1beta1.SeedTemplate `json:"seedTemplate,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=seedTemplate"`

   +	// SeedTemplate is tombstoned to show why 2 is reserved protobuf tag.
   +	// SeedTemplate *gardencorev1beta1.SeedTemplate `json:"seedTemplate,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=seedTemplate"`
   ```

   The reasoning behind this is to prevent the same protobuf number being used by a new field. Introducing a new field with the same protobuf number would be a breaking change for clients still using the old protobuf definitions that have the old field for the given protobuf number.
   The field in the internal version can be removed.

2. A unit test has to be added to make sure that a new field does not reuse the already reserved protobuf tag.

Example of field removal can be found in the [Remove `seedTemplate` field from ManagedSeed API](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/6972) PR.

#### Additional Steps When Removing a Field From the Shoot API

Removing fields from the Shoot API requires special handling because the removal is tied to specific Kubernetes versions and backwards compatibility must be maintained.
When removing defaulted fields, extra care is needed because these fields already exist in storage even when users never explicitly set them.

The deprecation and removal process takes two release cycles (three for defaulted fields):
1. In the first release:
    - Mark the field as deprecated.
    - Remove all code that uses the field (or ensure controllers can handle `nil` values for defaulted fields).
    - Forbid the field from being set for Kubernetes versions starting from the next minor version that will be supported by Gardener in a future release.
    - Show a warning to users that the field is deprecated and will be forbidden after a specific Kubernetes versions. Use the [`WarningsOnCreate`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/0bd160008f123cb268100f3316ef01d09c7fe84e/pkg/apiserver/registry/core/shoot/strategy.go#L207-L209) and [`WarningsOnUpdate`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/0bd160008f123cb268100f3316ef01d09c7fe84e/pkg/apiserver/registry/core/shoot/strategy.go#L211-L214) functions for this.
    - Update the [maintenance reconciler](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/0bd160008f123cb268100f3316ef01d09c7fe84e/pkg/controllermanager/controller/shoot/maintenance/reconciler.go) to set the field to `nil` during forced upgrades to Kubernetes versions where the field is forbidden.
2. *For defaulted fields only, in a subsequent release:*
    - Force the field to `nil` in the [`Canonicalize`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/0bd160008f123cb268100f3316ef01d09c7fe84e/pkg/apiserver/registry/core/shoot/strategy.go#L186-L190) function.
    - Update the warning from step (1) to inform users that the field is being automatically set to `nil`.
3. When Gardener drops support for the last Kubernetes version that allowed the deprecated field, remove the field completely from the API.

This approach prevents several problems:
  - Avoids issues when `gardener-apiserver` is upgraded to a version that sets fields to `nil` while other controllers are still running older versions.
  - Allows users to update `Shoot`s using `Get` and `{Update,Patch}` requests without manually setting deprecated fields to `nil`, even when those fields were automatically defaulted in previous releases.
  - Shows warnings when users explicitly set deprecated fields that will be automatically changed to `nil` by the [`Canonicalize`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/0bd160008f123cb268100f3316ef01d09c7fe84e/pkg/apiserver/registry/core/shoot/strategy.go#L186-L190) function. This warning is important because the update will increase the `Shoot`'s generation since the user's request (with the deprecated field set) differs from what is present in storage (where the field as `nil`).

Examples for the above can be seen in the following PRs: [Deprecate CA flag `maxEmptyBulkDelete`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12115), [Forbid setting the `Shoot`'s `.spec.kubernetes.clusterAutoscaler.maxEmptyBulkDelete` field for Kubernetes versions >= 1.33](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12413), and [Explicitly set `maxEmptyBulkDelete` to nil in `Canonicalize`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13054)

## Component Configuration APIs

Most Gardener components have a component configuration that follows similar principles to the Gardener API.
Those component configurations are defined in `pkg/{controllermanager,gardenlet,scheduler},pkg/apis/config`.
Hence, the above checklist also applies for changes to those APIs.
However, since these APIs are only used internally and only during the deployment of Gardener, the guidelines with respect to changes and backwards-compatibility are slightly relaxed.
If necessary, it is allowed to remove fields without a proper deprecation period if the release note uses the `breaking operator` keywords.

In addition to the above checklist:

1. If necessary, then adapt the Helm chart of Gardener defined in `charts/gardener`. Adapt the `values.yaml` file as well as the manifest templates.
