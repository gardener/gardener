# Cleanup of Shoot Clusters in Deletion

When a shoot cluster is deleted then Gardener tries to gracefully remove most of the Kubernetes resources inside the cluster.
This is to prevent that any infrastructure or other artifacts remain after the shoot deletion.

The cleanup is performed in four steps.
Some resources are deleted with a grace period, and all resources are forcefully deleted (by removing blocking finalizers) after some time to not block the cluster deletion entirely.

**Cleanup steps:**

1. All `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`s and `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`s are deleted with a `5m` grace period. Forceful finalization happens after `5m`.
1. All `APIService`s and `CustomResourceDefinition`s are deleted with a `5m` grace period. Forceful finalization happens after `1h`.
1. All `CronJob`s, `DaemonSet`s, `Deployment`s, `Ingress`s, `Job`s, `Pod`s, `ReplicaSet`s, `ReplicationController`s, `Service`s, `StatefulSet`s, `PersistentVolumeClaim`s are deleted with a `5m` grace period. Forceful finalization happens after `5m`.
   > If the `Shoot` is annotated with `shoot.gardener.cloud/skip-cleanup=true`, then only `Service`s and `PersistentVolumeClaim`s are considered.
1. All `VolumeSnapshot`s and `VolumeSnapshotContent`s are deleted with a `5m` grace period. Forceful finalization happens after `1h`.

It is possible to override the finalization grace periods via annotations on the `Shoot`:

- `shoot.gardener.cloud/cleanup-webhooks-finalize-grace-period-seconds` (for the resources handled in step 1)
- `shoot.gardener.cloud/cleanup-extended-apis-finalize-grace-period-seconds` (for the resources handled in step 2)
- `shoot.gardener.cloud/cleanup-kubernetes-resources-finalize-grace-period-seconds` (for the resources handled in step 3)

⚠️ If `"0"` is provided, then all resources are finalized immediately without waiting for any graceful deletion.
Please be aware that this might lead to orphaned infrastructure artifacts.
