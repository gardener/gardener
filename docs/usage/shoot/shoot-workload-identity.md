# Shoot Workload Identity

[`WorkloadIdentity`](../../api-reference/security.md#workloadidentity) is a resource that allows workloads to be presented before external systems by giving them identities managed by Gardener.
As `WorkloadIdentity`s do not directly contain credentials we gain the ability to create `Shoot`s without the need of preliminary exchange of credentials.
For that to work users should establish trust to the Gardener Workload Identity Issuer in advance.
The issuer URL can be read from the [Gardener Info ConfigMap](../gardener/gardener_info_configmap.md).

> [!TIP]
> `Shoot`s that were previously using `Secret`s as authentication method can also be migrated to use `WorkloadIdentity`.
> As the `credentialsRef` field of [`CredentialsBinding`](../../api-reference/security.md#credentialsbinding) is immutable,
> one would have to create a new `CredentialsBinding` that references a `WorkloadIdentity` and set the `.spec.credentialsBindingName` field of the `Shoot`
> to refer to the newly created `CredentialsBinding`.

As of now `WorkloadIdentity` is supported for AWS, Azure and GCP. For detailed explanation on how to enable the feature, please consult the provider extension specific documentation:
 - [provider-aws](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/blob/master/docs/usage/usage.md#aws-workload-identity-federation)
 - [provider-azure](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-azure/blob/master/docs/usage/usage.md#azure-workload-identity-federation)
 - [provider-gcp](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-gcp/blob/master/docs/usage/usage.md#gcp-workload-identity-federation)
