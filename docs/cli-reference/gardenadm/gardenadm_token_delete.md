## gardenadm token delete

Delete one or more bootstrap tokens from the cluster

### Synopsis

Delete one or more bootstrap tokens from the cluster.

The [token-value] is the ID of the token of the form "[a-z0-9]{6}" to delete.
Alternatively, it can be the full token value of the form "[a-z0-9]{6}.[a-z0-9]{16}".
A third option is to specify the name of the Secret in the form "bootstrap-token-[a-z0-9]{6}".

You can delete multiple tokens by providing multiple token values separated by spaces.

```
gardenadm token delete [token-values...] [flags]
```
