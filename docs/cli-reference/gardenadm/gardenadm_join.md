## gardenadm join

Bootstrap worker nodes and join them to the cluster

### Synopsis

Bootstrap worker nodes and join them to the cluster.

This command helps to initialize and configure a node to join an existing autonomous shoot cluster.
It ensures that the necessary configurations are applied and the node is properly registered as a worker or control plane node.

Note that further control plane nodes cannot be joined currently.
