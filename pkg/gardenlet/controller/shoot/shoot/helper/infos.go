// The shoot main controller calls CalculateControllerInfos for determining whether and when it should reconcile a given
// shoot based on its state and the gardenlet's configuration.
// This logic is super verbose for readability and documentation purposes.
// DO NOT TRY TO REFACTOR OR SIMPLIFY THIS!
// Regressions of this logic have high impact on large-scale gardener installations.
// We faced bugs and regressions of this logic in the past because it was short, unreadable, and undocumented.
// Hence, don't try to make it more "elegant"!

// ControllerInfos is the result of CalculateControllerInfos and informs the controller about whether and when a given
// shoot should be reconciled.
// These results are supposed to be used/handled immediately. Always call CalculateControllerInfos to re-calculate the
// results before using them.
// The exported fields are the exposed results, all other fields are for internal computations only.
