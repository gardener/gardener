# Please note:
# This script is only relevant for the local deployment with the operator and when using the Skaffold config `skaffold.yaml` or `skaffold-operator.yaml`.

# This script aims to solve the problem described in: https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/10209
# Both Skaffold configuration files, `skaffold.yaml` and `skaffold-operator.yaml`, generate dynamic patch files for Kustomize by invoking the following script through `build.hooks.after.command` lifecycle hooks:
# `hack/generate-kustomize-patch-gardenlet.sh`
# Since the patch files are not checked into the repository they are generated after Skaffold has built the artifacts.
# However, by default, Skaffold caches artifacts and does not rebuild them if the source files have not changed.
# Skaffold does not invoke build lifecycle hooks if the artifacts are cached.
# As part of the local deployment Kustomize is invoked to apply the patches generated by the script.
# If, for whatever reason, the patch files are not generated, Kustomize will fail to apply the patches and break the deployment.
# This script is a workaround that checks whether the patch files exist and that they contain the expected version pattern.
# It returns a literal boolean value to be passed to Skaffold's `--cache-artifacts` CLI flag.
