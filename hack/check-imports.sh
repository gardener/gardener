# This script uses import-boss to check import restrictions.
# It checks all imports of the given packages (including transitive imports) against rules defined in
# `.import-restrictions` files in each directory.
# An import is allowed if it matches at least one allowed prefix and does not match any forbidden prefixes.
# Note: "" is a prefix of everything
# Also see: https://github.com/kubernetes/code-generator/tree/master/cmd/import-boss

# Usage: `hack/check-imports.sh package [package...]`.
