# TODO(LucaBernstein): kindest/node images built with kind version `v0.26.0` and `v0.27.0` must not be used for the following reasons:
#  - `runc`: Starting with `v1.2.0`, we see tun/tap device issues with our vpn. We need to ensure at least `v1.2.4`: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4555.
#  - `containerd`: Starting with `v2.0.1`, we see issues where nodes become unready due to a race condition with the go-sni. We need to ensure the next version after `v2.0.2`: https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/11275.
#      The root cause is fixed with go-cni >= v1.1.12 (https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/11244).
