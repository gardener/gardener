                            the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
                            the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
                            merge patch.

                      map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
                      operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
