                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                          provisioner.
                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.
                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                    ephemeral:
                      description: |-
                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.

                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.

                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.
                      properties:
                        volumeClaimTemplate:
                          description: |-
                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                            This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                            to the PVC after it has been created.

                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                    set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                                    exists.

                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                            Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                            Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                                  of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.

                                  Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.

                                  ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
                                  combination of signer name and a label selector.

                                  Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
                                  into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                  comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                  The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                  may change the order over time.

                        RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled

                        If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                        If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                        recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                        recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                        field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                        supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                        an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                        If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                        None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                        If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.
