                                    The most recent recommended resources target computed by the autoscaler
                                    for the controlled pods, based only on actual resource usage, not taking
                                    into account the ContainerResourcePolicy.
                                    May differ from the Recommendation if the actual resource usage causes
                                    the target to violate the ContainerResourcePolicy (lower than MinAllowed
                                    or higher that MaxAllowed).
                                    Used only as status indication, will not affect actual resource assignment.
