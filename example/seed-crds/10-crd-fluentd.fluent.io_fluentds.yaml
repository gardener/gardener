                              between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                              only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                        value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod
                        can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise
                        this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it
                        is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not
                        evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict
                        immediately) by the system.
